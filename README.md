# Tensorflow Machine Learning projects with Python....

**1.** Lung Disease Model - **(configured the learning process of a model which-`diffrenciate between an infected or uninfected lung picture` and trained the model with `fit()` appplying the optimizer specified by `compile()` method).**

**2.** Hurricane_damage_detection_model - **(performed image aumentation on the image dataset which-`contians damaged and not damaged images` and displayed them in sub plots). **
