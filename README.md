# Tensorflow Machine Learning projects....

**1.** Lung Disease Model - **(configured the learning process of a model which-`diffrenciate between an infected or uninfected lung picture` and trained the model with `fit()` appplying the optimizer specified by `compile()` method).**

**2.** Hurricane_damage_detection_model - **(run `test.py` to get the full compilation and `main.py` for just the model summary).**
